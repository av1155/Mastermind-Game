# Mastermind Game with Progressive Difficulty

## Overview

This Java implementation of the classic Mastermind game introduces an innovative twist with its progressive difficulty feature. Designed to offer an increasingly challenging and engaging experience, this version of Mastermind pushes the traditional boundaries of the game, testing both the player's logic and adaptability skills.

## Game Mechanics

-   **Codeword Complexity**: At the core of the game is the dynamic codeword, which evolves in complexity as the player advances. Starting with a standard length and digit range, each new level introduces a longer codeword with a broader range of possible digits, making the game progressively harder.
-   **Interactive Gameplay**: The player engages in a series of guessing rounds, each time providing their best guess of the hidden codeword. The game offers immediate feedback on the accuracy of each guess, indicating how many digits are correct and in the right position (hits), and how many are correct but in the wrong position (misses).
-   **User Experience**: Special attention has been paid to the user interface to ensure a smooth and intuitive interaction. Clear instructions, real-time feedback, and a clean console presentation make the game accessible and enjoyable.

## Technical Highlights

-   **Java Development**: The game is entirely developed in Java, showcasing efficient use of the language's capabilities in handling game logic and user interaction.
-   **Algorithmic Complexity**: A key feature of this game is the algorithm that dynamically adjusts the codeword's complexity. This not only enhances the gameplay experience but also demonstrates a thoughtful approach to programming challenges.
-   **User Input Validation**: Robust input validation ensures a seamless user experience, gracefully handling unexpected or erroneous inputs without disrupting the game flow.

## Behind the Scenes

-   **Random Codeword Generation**: Each game round generates a new codeword randomly, ensuring a unique and unpredictable challenge.
-   **Level Progression System**: The level progression system is carefully designed to gradually increase the difficulty, balancing challenge with playability to keep players engaged.
-   **Replayability**: With its dynamic difficulty and random codeword generation, the game offers high replayability, inviting players to beat their previous records and continually challenge themselves.

## Reflection

This project is not just a game; it's a testament to the creativity and technical prowess in software development. Balancing algorithmic complexity with user-centric design, it reflects a deep understanding of what makes engaging software, from the logic that drives it to the experience it offers.
